This code creates a simplified version of the Planning App you provided. It includes:

    A top section with status information and menu icons
    A calendar section showing the current month
    A content section displaying today's plan and upcoming plans
    A floating action button (bubble menu) for adding new plans

The styling is done using CSS to create a clean, modern look similar to the original design. You can further 
customize the colors, fonts, and layout to match your preferences. To make this app fully functional, you would 
need to add more JavaScript to handle user interactions, data storage, and dynamic content updates. Additionally,
 you might want to consider 
using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js for more complex functionality and better state management.
